*Only tested for "qwerty Anne pro 2"*

This script translate a text file into obin macro string. That string can be add to obin sqlite macro section, for add macro to obin key board.

**Why this :**                                                                        
ObinLab app, is not intuitive or convenient for macro creation. So, i wrtited this script ...

**how ?**  
- Write macro inside a text file (special char on next section)
- Exec this script, with text file like arg
- Catch output with |, >, or some thing else
- Add this new macro into obin sqlite conf

**Special char :**

**Exemple :**
